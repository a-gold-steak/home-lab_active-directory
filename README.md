# Home Lab Running Active Directory - Documentation

## Introduction
Hello, here I have linked a github pages [site](https://a-gold-steak.github.io/home-lab_active-directory/#) that displays my documentation for the entire lab. 

I seperated each part into phases since there are about 80 plus pages. In total, there are nine phases. I have listed the phases below. If you are interested in a particular phase feel free to click one of the links below which will direct you to that phase. Thanks!

## Phases
- [Introduction](https://a-gold-steak.github.io/home-lab_active-directory/#intro)
- [Setup Windows Server 2022](https://a-gold-steak.github.io/home-lab_active-directory/#ws2022) 
- [Added an Ubuntu Client to the Domain](https://a-gold-steak.github.io/home-lab_active-directory/#ubuntu)
- [Installed Samba File Server](https://a-gold-steak.github.io/home-lab_active-directory/#samba)
- [Deployed Software to Clients with a GPO](https://a-gold-steak.github.io/home-lab_active-directory/#software) 
- [Enabled SSH on Devices](https://a-gold-steak.github.io/home-lab_active-directory/#ssh)
- [Access Controls and Other Additions](https://a-gold-steak.github.io/home-lab_active-directory/#acadd)

- [Deployed Network-Wide Print Server](https://a-gold-steak.github.io/home-lab_active-directory/#print)

## Improvements and Additions
I'm no AD expert and do apologize in advanced if there are mistakes. But there are a couple of items that I would've liked to have improved or added:
- A table of contents for the documentation would've been nice, I usually have one anytime I document anything but completely missed it this time around
- An addition of a second server would've been helpful to see how it would integrate into the network. This server could've been used to store the file shares or even updates
- I would've liked to have deployed different types of software. Not everything is able to be deployed smoothly and easily.(e.g. executable files)
- The addition of roaming profiles for clients would be helpful in case more clients are added
- As someone who is interested in the cloud, the addition of Azure's Active Directory would've been neat. Azure AD can be used to give clients access to Office365 or any of the many cloud applications available like Slack, Adobe's Creative Cloud, and Mailchimp
